# Personal Planning System {#pps}

This PPS/js system is a JavaScript/HTML implementation of a
[Personal Planning System](https://ponyatov.quora.com/On-computer-language-design-PPS-Personal-Planning-System-platform)
prototype extended with [metaprogramming](https://ponyatov.quora.com/On-computer-language-design-metaprogramming-1)
features. 

To understand the overall idea
first look this METAII workshop:
it is an online implementation of a
METAII metacompiler (by) D.V. Schorre
 
Here I implemented tiny draft with a
feel of METAII workshop described above.
But it uses PEG.js parser generator
works in your browser as a js library,
so you have full control over syntax
and semantics right in your hands.
 
How to use it

 
If you scroll this page now to right,
you'll see the cyan-colored window
with PEG grammar of some FORTH-like
script mixed with JavaScript code
will be executed on every rule match
