# Tree Script {#ts}
@brief extension for infix syntax & tree-based homoiconicity

@ref ts is an infix syntax extension for classical FORTH specially dedicated
for manipulating complex (hyper)graph and data tree structures, wildly used in
* computer software analysis
* metaprogramming
* document databases

@ref ts also solves another big problem of the classical FORTH: code readability.
For example, if you do some very simple math computations,
almost nobody and yourself can't understand your code doing stack banging
with `dup`/`swap` and postfix commands.
